ItsOnFire!
A simple web interface and API to trigger a warning. Code taken from https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-esp8266-micropython-web-server/

Use case:

* Have zabbix call a web trigger when an alert is required.
* The main purpose in this case is to make a warning beacon flash when there is an issue in zabbix, but you can plug anything that is 3v capable.

Installation (Linux)

* apt install pip
* apt install vscode
